Extract the `transcript_path` field from it — this is the path to the conversation JSONL transcript file.\n\nYour task:\n1. Read the transcript JSONL file at the extracted `transcript_path`.\n2. The transcript is a JSONL file (one JSON object per line). Each line has a `type` field (e.g. \"human\", \"assistant\", \"tool_use\", \"tool_result\"). Focus on \"human\" messages (user input) and \"assistant\" messages (Claude's response).\n3. **Handling long transcripts**: The file may be very large for long sessions. Apply these truncation rules when reading:\n   - For each message, if the text content exceeds 500 characters, keep only the LAST 500 characters (the tail is usually more informative than the head).\n   - For tool_use/tool_result entries, only note the tool name and a one-line summary — skip the full input/output.\n   - If the file has more than 200 lines, focus on the LAST 200 lines (most recent part of the conversation).\n4. Analyze the conversation: identify what was discussed, what decisions were made, what code was written or modified, and any important outcomes.\n5. Write a concise summary (3-8 bullet points) of the session.\n6. Determine today's date and current time. Create the directory `.memsearch/memory/` if it doesn't exist.\n7. Append the summary to `.memsearch/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (using today's date) formatted as:\n   ## Session HH:MM\n   - bullet point 1\n   - bullet point 2\n   ...\n8. After writing, run: memsearch index .memsearch/memory/\n   If memsearch is not found, try: uv run memsearch index .memsearch/memory/\n   If that also fails, skip indexing (the summary file is still saved).\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- If the transcript is empty or cannot be read, do nothing.\n- If `stop_hook_active` is true in the input JSON, do nothing (prevents infinite loops).\n- Keep your work fast — you have a 60-second timeout.\n\n$ARGUMENTS",
